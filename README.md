# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Microsoft Excel is a simple, yet powerful tool for organizing, cleaning, and analyzing large datasets. In this mini-project, I took a sample dataset and applied concepts like filters, pivot tables, and measures of central tendency to discover complex relationships.
### Purpose
I was tasked with helping a playwright launch a crowdfunding campaign for her new play by organizing and analyzing raw Kickstarter data containing funding goals, pledge amounts, launch dates, project category, and other information. Her budget was $10,000, and she needed my help to find factors that might improve her chance of success.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
