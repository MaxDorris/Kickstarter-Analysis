# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
---
I was tasked with helping a playwright launch a crowdfunding campaign for her new play by analyzing Kickstarter data. Her budget was $10,000, and she needed my help to find factors that might improve her chance of success. The analysis was executed with pivot tables in Microsoft Excel.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
